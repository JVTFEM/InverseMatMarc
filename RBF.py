# NB: This file was written for a specific project to use linear and RBF interpolation schemes. This file can be rewritten
# as desired by the user, but the rest of the pipeline will have to be adjusted accordingly.

# This file was coded by assuming that the FE analysis used remeshing. Therefore the input file is used to obtain the
# nodes for tracking. The code is written by assuming the FE models were constructed in a specific sequence and
# the instructions to the whole pipeline needs to be read first.

# // In this file the RBF_int function interpolates the nodal data from the "NUM" model to the same nodal locations of the
# "EXP"  model to obtain the same number nodes for both data sets. This is done by first obtaining the locations of each
# node at each increment for the y-displacement of the indentor in both the "NUM" and "EXP" data. Since
# the "NUM" data needs to fit the "EXP" data, the "EXP" data's node coordinates are used. Also both "NUM" and "EXP" data are
# obtained through Marc which is an iterative solver, therefore at each solving increment of the indentor's y-displacement, there
# are more than one sub-increment with the last sub-increment at that solver increment is the sub-increment which contains the
# converged data for the level,thus only the last sub-incremental data are used. 
# After the data has been organised into the indentor increments, for the specific number of nodes presents in the "NUM"
# and "Exp" data respectively, the interpolation can start. First the "NUM" data is linearly interpolated to the missing increments 
# for the "EXP" data's indentor displacements. There after Radial basis functions (RBF) are used to interpolate the current
# level's "NUM" data to the nodal locations of the "EXP" data.
