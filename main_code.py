# This file is the main code from where all the other files are accessed. To start the whole optimisation process and 
# the pipeline, only this file need to be run from Python, and the rest will be accessed as desired.
#
# The pipeline assumes a Mooney-Rivlin three parameter material model is used, with the C01, C10 and C20 as the
# parameters. Also it is assumed that 3D displacement field is used.

# The code does account for 2D and also the Mooney-Rivlin two parameter model with parameters C01 and C10. But might 
# contain some minor bugs and is not guaranteed to run smoothly.

# The whole pipeline can also be used to test two optimisation algorithms. During such a procedure only the type of
# algorithm need to be changed in line 273 . Therefore, this file will run for the 1st algorithm, there after the 
# a few changes are needed in the lines and files below and then this file need to be run again:
#       -   "main_code.py"
#               - lines 179 - 202 explain what needs to be done in this file.
#       - "graphs.py"
